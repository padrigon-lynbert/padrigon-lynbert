Hi there, I'm Siv.

I started programming in junior high when I discovered it was the foundation of game development. During my senior years, I explored various technologies to satisfy my overlapping interests. In college, I found my passion for predictive models, which led me to dive into machine learning.

I now focus on practicing and building deep learning models, continuously improving my skills in AI developmentâ€”or as I prefer to call it, creating and integrating machine learning models into application interfaces. I'm always open to learning new things, collaborating on innovative projects, and exploring this niche.
