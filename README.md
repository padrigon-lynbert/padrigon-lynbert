__Hi there, I'm Siv.__

I started programming in junior high when I discovered it was the foundation of game development. During my senior years, I explored various technologies to satisfy my overlapping interests. In college, I found my passion for predictive models, which led me to dive into machine learning.

I now focus on practicing and building deep learning models, improving my skills in AI developmentâ€”or as I prefer to call it, creating and integrating models into application interfaces. I'm always open to learning new things, collaborating on innovative projects, and exploring this niche.

âœ¨ __Focus Areas:__ Python-Deep Learning, Python-PyTorch, Django(Render/Railway), Hugging Face  
âœ¨ __Currently Exploring:__ Fine Tuning, AI model deployment
