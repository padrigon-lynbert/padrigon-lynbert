PUBLIC INFO:

```
  I’m an early bird and a night owl. So I’m wise and I have worms.
  If you think I am hating you, you probably misunderstood. I don’t do that.
  I may disappear for months, it’s not personal I'm prob. dealing with clients.
  I pursue an ambitious dream and am drawn to same others in which I rarely see.
  All men are lizards beneath their civilized skin. I am the fucking lizard king.
  I am collecting rares gotta catch ’em all: mentors, peers, and people I can learn from.
  I am already part of the largest club in the world: the rare-church-going christians.
  Currently focused on growth. Relationships aren’t a priority. But I won’t avoid trying, I am not a monk.
