PUBLIC INFO:

```
  I’m an early bird and a night owl. So I’m wise and I have worms.
  If you think I am hating you, you probably misunderstood. I don’t do that.
  I may disappear for months, it’s not personal I'm prob. dealing with clients.
  I pursue an ambitious dream and am drawn to same others in which I rarely see.
  All men are lizards beneath their civilized skin. I am the fucking lizard king.
  For everything of course, All thanks to God. And maybe a few demons he let slide.
  I am already part of the largest club in the world: the rare-church-going christians.
  I am collecting rares gotta catch ’em all: mentors, peers, and people I can learn from.
  A great friend too, decades-long friend streak. Definitely a keeper -mostly of skeletons.
  Everything I am is because of my parents, best regards ~son. And some things better left unexplained.
  Never broken a promise, 100% keeping streak. Credibility intact... unlike the bodies I leave in my wake.
  Currently focused on growth. Relationships aren’t a priority. But I won’t avoid trying, I am not a monk.

If you reached this part, you're basically almost done. I am usualy quietter and not usually this abrupt. Those are just complexity mixed with philosophy and humor to filter out people I don't want in my life.
If you are comfortable with that we will surely get along. Hi, I'm Siv. Let's meet sometimes, stay safe.
