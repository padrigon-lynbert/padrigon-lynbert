__Hi there, I'm Siv.__

I started programming in junior high when I discovered it was the foundation of game development. During my senior years, I explored various technologies to satisfy my overlapping interests. In college, I found my passion for predictive models, which led me into machine learning.

I now focus on practicing and building deep learning models,  
creating and integrating models into webapp interfaces.

Currently I'm facing some hardware drawbacks so I can't really explore it that deep unless I use models as api.

âœ¨ __Focus Areas:__ SK-Learn, Python-Deep Learning, Python-PyTorch, Django(Render/Railway), Hugging Face
âœ¨ __Currently Exploring:__ Fine Tuning, AI model deployment
