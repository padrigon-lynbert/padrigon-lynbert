PUBLIC INFO:

```
  I’m an early bird and a night owl. So I’m wise and I have worms.
  If you think I am hating you, you probably misunderstood. I don’t do that.
  I may disappear for months, it’s not personal I'm prob. dealing with clients.
  All men are lizards beneath their civilized skin. I am the fucking lizard king.
  For everything of course, All thanks to God. And maybe a few demons he let slide.
  I am already part of the largest club in the world: the rare-church-going christians.
  I am collecting rares gotta catch ’em all: mentors, peers, and people I can learn from.
  A great friend too, decades-long friend streak. Definitely a keeper -mostly of skeletons.
  Everything I am is because of my parents, best regards ~son. And some things better left unexplained.
  Never broken a promise, 100% keeping streak. Credibility intact... unlike the bodies I leave in my wake.
  Currently focused on growth. Relationships aren’t a priority. But I won’t avoid trying, I am not a monk.
  I pursue an ambitious dream and am drawn to same others in which I rarely see. But between you and me, I'd say I am more likely to fail. Hey don't say that to anyone I’ll look bad in front of the girls.

If you reached this part, you're basically almost done. I am usualy quietter and not usually this abrupt. Those are just complexity mixed with philosophy and humor to filter out people I don't want in my life.
If you are comfortable with that we will surely get along. Hi, I'm Siv. Let's meet sometimes, stay safe.    
<br>And this is github I know, not professional? com'on we already know what we can do no need to sound corporate. My repos are there most good are private although. What we need are less depressed programmers now. Have some break.

I mostly work with netherbuild where we help (most) construction contractors do faster quotation(in seconds), crm, automation, just website and things. Normal people won't see my github profile anyway, so... interesting human let's connect!
