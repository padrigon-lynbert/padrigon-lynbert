__Hi there, I'm Siv.__

I started programming in junior high when I discovered it was the foundation of game development. During my senior years, I explored various technologies to satisfy my overlapping interests. In college, I found my passion for predictive models, which led me to dive into machine learning.

I now focus on practicing and building deep learning models, continuously improving my skills in AI developmentâ€”or as I prefer to call it, creating and integrating machine learning models into application interfaces. I'm always open to learning new things, collaborating on innovative projects, and exploring this niche.

âœ¨ __Focus:__ Python, Scikit-learn, NumPy, PyTorch, Django, Hugging Face


 âœ¨ __Support:__ HTML, CSS,  Bootstrap, MySQL, SQLite, Windows, Git, GitHub, Vscode, Jupyter(ipynb)

âœ¨ __Getting Acquainted:__ SQL

âœ¨ __Previously Used / Explored:__  Unity, Unreal Engine, Blender, Android Studio, Visual Studio, Codeblocks, Pycharm, DevC++, C, C++, C#, Java, Linux Mint, PHP, JavaScript
